# Intune Certificate Manager Scripts
A couple of PowerShell scripts to manage multiple certificates within Intune. 

## Why use this?
If you have ever loaded a chain of certificates for large organizations, you will find it very time consuming importing every root and intermediate certs into Intune. 
The next problem is there is no way of knowing which certificates is expired and is no longer needed. 

I developed this to resolve both of those issues.

## What it does

There are two script and I will give an explanation to each of them
- **Import-IntuneCertificates.ps1** - This will import 3 types of certificates (root, intermediate, and user) into their appropriate certificate store. The script will parse cer files within the folders plus JSON files exported from other Intune environment. 
- **Remove-IntuneCertificates.ps1** - This will remove certificates based on expiration. It will export the cert and view it to determine if it expired.

- **AssignAADGroup** - NOT READY. Provide the Azure AD Group or ID to assign each certificate to. If policy set is specified it will check for that assignment as well. 
- **JSONOnly** - Switch. Only imports JSON files in the JSON folder. Ignores any cer file in the Root, Intermediate, and User folders
- **IncludeExpired** - Switch. Imports certificates that are expired as well. Any JSON that doesn't have the populated description with _Expires:_ will import

## Remove Options

## Additional options:
 
 - the **-WhatIf** command is supported and allows for testing prior to import or removal. 
 - the **-Verbose** is also supported and will output additional details...however the output may not be cleanly displayed.
