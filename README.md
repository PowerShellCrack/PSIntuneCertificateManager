# Intune Certificate Manager Scripts
A couple of PowerShell scripts to manage multiple certificates within Intune. 

## Why use this?
If you have ever loaded a chain of certificates for large organizations, you will find it very time consuming importing every root and intermediate certs into Intune. 
The next problem is there is no way of knowing which certificates is expired and is no longer needed. 

I developed this to resolve both of those issues.

## What it does

There are two scripts:
- **Import-IntuneCertificates.ps1** - This will import 3 types of certificates (root, intermediate, and user) into their appropriate certificate store. The script will parse cer files within the folders plus JSON files exported from other Intune environment. 
> NOTE. There are folders this script will look at (but are not in repo). Folders: Root, Intermediate, User and JSON. If you want to import scripts, create these folders and place the respective cert your importing into them

- **Remove-IntuneCertificates.ps1** - This will remove certificates based on expiration. It will export the cert and view it to determine if it expired.

# Typical examples to manage cert

Create only _non-expired_ certificate profiles and assign to all **Windows** devices
```powershell
PS> .\Import-IntuneCertificates.ps1 -AssignAADGroup 'AllDevices'
```

Create only _non-expired_ certificate profiles and assign to all **iOS** devices
```powershell
PS> .\Import-IntuneCertificates.ps1 -PlatformType iOS -AssignAADGroup 'AllDevices'
```

Create only _non-expired_ certificate profiles and assign to Azure AD group
```powershell
PS> .\Import-IntuneCertificates.ps1 -AssignAADGroup 'SG-AZ-DeviceGrp-TestDevices'
```

Remove _expired_ certificate profile **assignments** only
```powershell
PS> .\Remove-IntuneCertificates.ps1 -JustAssignments
```

Remove _expired_ certificate profiles
```powershell
PS> .\Remove-IntuneCertificates.ps1
```


## Additional options:
 
 - the **-WhatIf** command is supported and allows for testing prior to import or removal. 
 - the **-Verbose** is also supported and will output additional details...however the output may not be cleanly displayed. 

# Notes/Issues

- Currently only group assignments are working. Policy Set assigning will be coming shortly
- Any JSON that doesn't have the populated description with _Expires:_ will import
- Script do not detect filtered assignments or remove filters from assignments
